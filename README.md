Cacao-Carbon-Nexu A biophysical and economic model of agricultural waste for smallholder : case study on cacao

# PROBLEMATIQUE
For those have once interacted with famers specially in cacao sector, they may have noticed that famers are interested in only the beans. Some byproducts like cocoa puds husk have been left on the farms in pile. They are called waste or no needed. After few days, those socalled waste start being a source of methan which is realeased in atmosphere. whislt smalholders are facing low income, fertilizer and climate change drawback. 

# Solution
Compost is well known or heard product as an organic fertilizer. This compost could also be a gateway for improving smalholder income, allivate CO2 release by farmer sides. The core concept is passing from waste to carbon credits. here's the flow:

State 1: the waste is left rot anaorobically  leads to lossing of income, enviroment's strike.
State 2 :  Smalholders are avoiding the state 1 by composting the cocoa pud which allows them to create Carbon credits.
State 3 : -they  could sell the Carbon credis as a second source of revenue, 
          - they could decrease the cost production through the fertilizer
          - and the whole world is gaining by reducing atmosphere greenhouse gaz
